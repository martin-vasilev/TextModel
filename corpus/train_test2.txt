And now you're hungry, and you're thirsty, and you've got really boring stuff to wear. Well, you're not alone. It's what happens to most men when they hear the word style.

I'm not sure about where we're really going.
How do we face the future in light of these discoveries? How do people of faith go on? How do those who have been victimized rise beyond the personal horrors of the past? And where do people of hope look for the ability to survive? Such answers really do exist when we look to the truth.
