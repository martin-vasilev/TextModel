When I was a young teacher, we used the verb " educate " to speak about what we were doing with the children of poor people as well as the children of rich people. Today in the inner city, the operative verb is not " educate " but " train. " Both school officials and business leaders fall into this pattern.
But your home would be a very awkward and uncomfortable place without them. Take a look on the roof. Is there a satellite dish or TV antenna there? A cable for cable TV?

But I shouted him a question at the end about these developments in the Gulf. And he told me that he sees this as a positive development. But, as you noted, these tests are still ongoing. So, the president said he doesn't want to get ahead of that.

FATHER 1 Well, what is it? # BRENT # All three of the victims attended our public high school and all three were or appear to have been... um... virgins. There is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium. MOTHER 1 So? MOTHER 2 (very concerned) You're almost positive that's who this monster is targeting? MOTHER 1 Virgins?
It took five minutes for the host just to take our order. The cashier began to get our drinks before we had finished telling her what we wanted. We ended up repeating our order several times, and she still forgot one item. We decided to do without rather than repeat the process. We asked for the pizza ($ 7.50-$ 8.50) and heirloom tomato salad ($ 6.
Certainly in my family, between my father and myself, there were years in which we could barely have a conversation. All these things that happened. And there's never been a place to process that.

The signal will be transmitted about half a mile away to the US District Courthouse where 23 grand jurors will watch the president on live television and will actually be allowed to ask their own questions by passing those questions through prosecutors on the telephone.

You now have the vast majority of members of the House of Representatives having been elected since the Berlin Wall came down- this is a post-cold war Congress. You have the- the Senate brand-new, and a lot of new people in the Senate who were never there for the- the major fights, even the Gulf War fight, which was just in 1991.
Because of this, and again the lure of major airlines, the Air Force is projecting a short-fall of 1,800 pilots by the year 2002. And that's not all. Air Force pilots must constantly stay trained, but now they aren't training as often. A shortage of spare parts, aging aircraft, and fewer maintenance people means fewer aircraft that are operational.
You figure 450 million magazines sold in the U.S. each months, an average of four cards in every newsstand copy and two or three for every one delivered to your door, that's- let's see, carry the two- that's about a billion cards a month destined to hit the deck.

I worried that if I didn't seize this opportunity with him, I'd regret it. So after a pause, I told Dave that although I liked him, I wasn't sure if I was " ready " to be in a serious relationship. I asked for a few days to think about it. Amazingly, he agreed. The next day, I went to my reunion.
His daughter. Your sister. You're family, " he said. " Remember that. " She could not take her eyes from the gun. " You want some food? " he said at last. " It comes from the dining room upstairs.

Do you want to run the tape? KING: I don't have the tape. LEWIS I have it, and I said, " Some women comedians make me uncomfortable, " because a man comedian can do anything he wants and I'm not offended by it. But we're talking about a God-given miracle who produces a child. I have a difficult time seeing her do this on stage.
It didn't help. By the time he reached the fence posts, the hogs were nearly on him. Their snorts and fierce squeals made the hairs stand up on the back of his neck. He could almost feel their hot breath on his calves as he crossed the bar ditch. When he started down the side of the ditch, he turned his ankle and almost fell.
Every year there were a few more men and their wives who built a house in the woods. The Indians appeared at the edge of the forest and watched, devils that they were.

My first time was in college with a guy who was on the football team with my roommate. Tara: Had you been thinking about experimenting? Jason: I had a little, but I never wanted to hit on somebody or anything like that. That wasn't in me at all, But my roommate was gone for the weekend, and the teammate came over. And we had some drinks.
That creates a real shock. NELSON: And the reason to focus on distribution isn't so much to say that- you know-it's to point out the issue that the food supply is only one dimension to the problem we face. And you can't really solve the problems of hunger by increasing supply. You have to focus on who- how to- who and how you're assisting with it.
On the positive side, Michael looked at it as a great growing experience, and it made him realize what he needs to do to win a Grand Slam. I don't think the world has seen the best of Michael yet. " Dent also agreed that the French championship did not harm Chang. " If you win a Grand Slam any time in your life, it's the right time, " he said.
Magnum shooters had assembled in New York on September 10th for a business meeting. The next morning, the story of these times burst over their heads. They did what photographers do by training, instinct, and probably trait and personality: They picked up their cameras and started shooting.
What we're doing is obviously trying to keep the lines of communication open. When they do get work, when they're able to start paying their bills back, we want to hear from them. I had an interesting situation last week. A gentleman called me. He's a self-contractor. He had been on a payment plan, and he stopped for a few months.
" I'd call every day after my father's abduction and my brother wouldn't take my calls. He was always my closest brother. Why couldn't he talk to me? The atmosphere of our visits is very demeaning.

Why do you all move to the side... then you don't understand... have to ask again... I must find my aim once more... after all... it's not a machine gun. " He caught his breath and said in quite a different tone, almost distinctly: " I thought we would not meet for another four years. " " They let me out sooner, for good behavior. " " Good behavior?
Then it occurred to me that I didn't know what the rules would have been if Emory had gone to pick up the rings. Or maybe I did. A raging black male would have unleashed a SWAT team of security guards. We sailed through City Hall on our lunch hour, expecting nothing in the way of congratulations and receiving nothing but the paperwork we needed.
HILL I don't think there's any question of that, that they do exist, and they have been in the service. SMITH: And that they probably did a-- did a-- did as good or-- a job as any-- anyone else you served with? Rear Adm. HILL I can not-- I can not answer that, because I don't know who they are.
I think it was basically said he could probably get as many as 75 votes if he was willing specifically to protect Social Security in the debate.

As their coach, I know that soccer players have to learn to use both feet. So I encourage them to use the " off " foot. There is no magic trick I can teach them. They just have to do it. If they do, they will get better at it, and one day they will feel as natural kicking with the " off " foot as they do with their primary foot.
Offering suggestions or solutions, in my view, has everything to do with how credible an author or a speaker is. And without credibility, no speaker or writer has a chance to win over the hearts and minds of any audience.

Though he always had work to do, he did not rush through his tasks. There was almost always enough time to fix a broken fence, treat and stroke a sick animal, collect grain that had spilled in the field, tell an amusing story or answer the questions of an eager child. He was as fully present to the world as any person I have ever known.
CALLER: I'm in three feet of water on the bridge, I'm going to stay by the radio as long as I can before I have to go overboard. MILLER: A massive rescue effort was launched, helicopters and ambulances were rushed to a staging area to assist survivors. Radio calls painted a grim picture. CALLER: We have 21 souls on board, twenty in the water right now.
He hugged the wall, trying to think of some better choice, all the while trying to hear how many there were. The presence moved in two parts. Like a snake, he thought, swallowing hard. Or a single goblin dragging something, like a sack, or a body. The gate to the outside might still be open.
Back then, no one even thought to mention that the statute treated men and women differently. Charlie Miller hopes this case will be different. His name is actually no longer on the case, since the government successfully challenged his legal standing to be in the case at an earlier point.
Q. Are you and the E Street Band getting back together? A. Well, I don't know. It's been 10 years, and everybody's living in different places and doing different things.

That's where you get the information I'm willing to give up. " There's something kind of great and noble about this, of course, but it's also great that he has a wife like Ann, who at times seems willing to tell more about her husband than maybe he ever can. THE FIRST REVELATION, though, is Leary's.

It was pure ritual, made necessary by the desire of everyone concerned not to contemplate the violence about to occur inside a huge industry. The official story was that these new black boxes would not destroy the television industry as we know it and undermine the businesses of all those who depend on the television to sell their products.
I was under so much stress at that time that I don't know if I could have made it without her. It seemed that fate just brought us together. " So, here we are again.

One day he picked up an old classical guitar he'd bought at a garage sale, tuned it up, and played a few chords. He showed me a thing or two about the basics and how to tune the instrument properly.

In any case, investigations would be announced, studies would be conducted, data collected, reports written, findings made public. Changes would then be instituted, and if the process worked the way it was supposed to, that particular accident would never happen again. Or at least not quite the same way. In time, the Great Galactic Ghoul was forgotten.
I'm resigned. In fact, I'm realizing I've made some choices along the way that put me equally at blame here. It's not your fault, babe. You are who you are.

It was an extraordinary enterprise accomplished in just a few days. Mr-SIDES: Twelve hours after they learned about the raid, they were on the ground, marching towards the camp.

Whitehead, the renowned owner of a boutique in suburban Detroit, where I grew up, told me about the city then, about the money and the embrace of fashion.

If I could have a chance to have a magical power, I wouldn't. I spent a long time trying to figure out what I would want to do or become. Would I rid people of pain? Would I learn to fly, speak all languages, or become an elf? None of these. I realized that I'm happy just the way I am. I have a good family, nice friends, and a lot of books.
They went ahead and hired a guy who two weeks later didn't work out. So they called me back and said they'd give me a try. I've known I was a lesbian since I was around 10. But I don't think I actually met a gay person until I was 12 or 13.
I had known him all my life, and I fell in love with a violence that quite terrified me. We had an affair, all one summer; I shall never forget it.

He watched the interest start to die in their eyes. Why volunteer, why take a chance with your life if you couldn't tell if you'd made a difference? " But you might, " he added quickly.

I know Michael hasn't stopped trying, but the boys won't be so easily won over. I've done my best to stay out of it. Nothing will ever change the fact that he's their father; how they choose to deal with him is up to them. I refuse to encourage either boy to forgive and forget, but I won't hold them back from a relationship with Michael, either.
By mid decade the positive rating was up to 34 percent, last year 60 percent and today our polls show 72 percent of Americans say the economy is at least good.

And how about a little bit for our culture? (APPLAUSE) Listen to this: Both Al Gore and George W. Bush are on the same page, tearing away the safety net for poor women and their children. That's called phony welfare reform and they're both on the same page on that one.
And in the absence of any gleam, I listen to his breathing, the only sound now in the world, and it's soft and regular-very much, I fear, like the breathing of a sleeper; but the next moment, he suddenly takes a bigger breath, and exhales more fully, not quite a sigh, but like a sigh: a whispered, disappointed sound.
But-- well, what's a man to do? I'll allow I've lost me temper a time or two and pushed her a bit. " " Good for you. Keep it up.

If there's not enough food for both mother and baby, the baby gets the lion's share.
It is possible for people to bring misfortune on themselves.

Many seniors understand that Social Security is social insurance as opposed to a program where we put money aside for our own retirement.

When this doesn't happen, they get discouraged. But if you're overweight, losing even 5 or 10 percent of your body weight can have substantial health benefits, reducing your risk factors, like high blood pressure, for such chronic diseases as Type 2 diabetes.

But I feel with a great degree of certainty that we're going to carry this technology into our own self modification.

It's going to happen perhaps at a convention center in Baghdad and there's much being made of the fact there will be wide access to the Arab media.

" My wife and I sometimes use a blindfold during foreplay, " says Joe, 39, a New York painter. " When I can't see, my other senses seem much sharper.

MICHAEL-FAY: Well, you know, the landscape there is flat, but the vegetation is quite dense, and the grass is very high.

Nothing you can do about all that. Sometimes I wish that I were someone else. It is a burden being so strong and wise. Sometimes I wish that I were a stone, a tree, a bird, or my friend Morris, who once almost kissed me. Yes, sometimes I wish I could rest at the bottom of a lake forever.

He had managed fairly well, too until she had let him in of her own accord. But it was a brief encounter, to short for him to do more than sense something, something Something unexpected.

Jaws dropped every time I bumped into someone; a few old friends didn't recognize me and walked right past. I had also underestimated how new hair throws off your beauty routine. On one of my first mornings as a blonde, none of my makeup looked right. My blush was all wrong, and my favorite blue eyeliner looked tacky.
Later on I heard that he had joined the harem of the band's drummer and was traveling the world as a groupie. Still later I heard that he had disappeared into the sexual underworld of Bangkok, where I'm sure he's surviving, as usual. At any rate, he's finally seeing the world. " " Third, " I said, and hesitated. " The girl I was telling you about, Willie.
Alas, that's not how the Social Security Trust Fund works. Today, because the baby boom generation is hard at work, the government collects more money from Social Security taxes than it pays in Social Security benefits.

Late in 1986 there were student demonstrations in most of the larger Chinese cities. Shanghai was shut down for two days. No one outside China took any notice. This past spring I returned to China for a third time, to have a look at what the newspapers were calling the " Chinese miracle.
Or any brothers I ever saw. " Neither of us knew how to respond, so we were quiet for a moment. People in our neighborhood pretended not to notice our appearance, and it felt like the time someone had stolen the only towel I owned out of my gym locker and left it out on the bench- like an intrusion of the most intimate kind.
Because of peer pressure, merely providing information about health risks resulting from excessive drinking, and about the dangers of drinking and driving to students is not enough. They need help in developing the ability to refuse drinks when offered by their peers. They need to want to say no, and they need to know how to say it.
And finally, let me say how profoundly indebted I am tonight. Beyond the folks at home, beyond the wonderful people who worked in this administration- the lieutenant governor and others- to keep our government going, beyond all the others, I have to say a special word of thanks to my magnificent running mate, Senator Al Gore and his family.
With a budget of $9.9 million, " Mo' Better Blues " represents Mr. Lee's most costly effort, but one well within Hollywood's bargain basement. Besides economy and success, the films share an evolving ensemble on both sides of the camera. Mr.

" He'd always been interested in art. His mother and a grandmother were artists of sorts. " My mother tried to do drawings and wanted to go to architecture school, but had no education. Sons can have enormous empathy for their mothers. But I couldn't imagine taking her place or filling those shoes.
I wouldn't have played well no matter what kind of clubs I used. My ball striking was so bad. I fell into this horrible spiral. Before, if I wasn't hitting the ball well, I could chip and putt, but then I couldn't even do that. I'm a hard worker, and I don't quit. I kept working. But whether it was my personal life or my golf game, it wasn't getting better.
I hate to lose so much I usually don't play at all. Pride, I suppose. They were unable to beat it out of me at that reservation school. I'm a big sinner in that category. So there I am. I turn my head a second to check on Paul, and what does Old Lady Kern do but snap on a king, just a Hash out of the corner of my eye.

We talked about some real personal things in her life, and I immediately thought she was a real positive person. She had personality. So I was looking forward to hanging out with her.

There was something else to it as well. Judith didn't know if it was because Henry saw his sales job as a duty to his family rather than his passion, or because he hated being away from home so much, but it seemed that every interaction he had with their son held an underlying tension: Don't make the same mistakes I've made.
They're in this together and if we can pin some of the blame on her, it will rub off on him. LINDEN SOLES: Well, why don't we find out first hand how this is sitting with some members of the voting public? We have a caller who's been holding on the line from Georgia.

It was Steve. He'd left several messages for her at the office-and then at home. " Jill phoned me, and said you e-mailed her, " he admitted. " Listen, you're freaking out over nothing.

And yes, we're asked, typically the oldest child, at the age of roughly five or six, to be that interface and to interpret. But at five or six, I read somewhere where a typical five, six-year-old has acquired approximately 3,000 words.

Incredibly, it took two more shots before he stayed down. Sweating fiercely, I let the weapon drop out of Larry's hand, but kept hold of his arm. Guilt can be an incredible burden. I should know. It took all my willpower to hoist Larry, drag him back to the console, and place his hand on the laser controls.
I'm crying like I am a child again. " What about me? " I say to him. The way his face is slack I can see that he feels these tears with me. He'd like to cry too, if only he could. He's too good to be an angel. " Forgive me, " he says, and I can't tell if he's talking to me or to God. He lays a warm hand on my cheek.
Turning the water off, she lifts one of the folded linen towels from the shelf above the sink and wipes the drops away from the glass. Then she looks at herself, turns her face to the side a little. It's a face she has never really liked the look of, and now it seems too pale, the lips too dark.
We all are. They've taken bets at my club-- " " Down! " Rose threw her weight to the right, but her strength was not sufficient to move them both out of danger.

Also in her own words, audio tapes made by the former first lady, Jackie Kennedy. This is really fascinating stuff. Offering an inside look at the white-- at the Kennedy White House and she has some choice comments about key figures in the 1960s. Really interesting stuff. You should hear this. Plus why is this man laughing and dancing in prison?
And as positive as it can be, it can be really that negative for you. And I can so relate to what Diana and Charles are having to go through.

It was the first time I've done it in many years. So, you know, other than the flu, I feel young and sexy again just thinking about him. It's nice to have a reason to shave my legs again.
I can't be bothered to give them a dictation-- the most profitable way to occupy time-- because it means reading papers at home in front of the TV, so I say, " Get your books. " " It's not Friday!

One more kiss? " and she said " Shut the door first? " He did and she put her arms out and he leaned over to kiss her. It didn't work as a big kiss. His body was too twisted, and something about the angle so their faces didn't quite meet. He got on one knee and brought her face down to his and they kissed. " That was better, no?
And at every office party, family function, and holiday get-together, I always hear the same thing: " C'm on, it's once a year! Relax and enjoy yourself! Live a little! " I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm never sure who they're trying to convince-- me or themselves.
I say with emphasis that without the wise policies which the Republican Party has brought into action during this period, no such progress would have been possible. The first responsibility of the Republican administration was to renew the march of progress from its collapse by the war....
17). Apparently the child told a lie and as punishment was told to write an essay on lying. This is a punishment fitting of the deed.

On staff you're-- you're sort of at the mercy of whatever the agency, whatever business they have and they tell you to work on.

I'm sorry. " I was going to say, For what?, but she pulled away in a hurry, appearing panicked, and fled up the stairs.

Flirting? The divorce?
There's no connection between unemployment, where most immigrants are going to high employment areas, not high unemployment areas. So there is no connection between the two data.

All of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents, the way Elizabeth has come back to us. And I just hope and pray that Congress will quickly pass the AMBER Alert, so that those children will have a better chance, because they cross the state line and they're out of commission. And we need to have this here. We really do.
... " In that house, there lives a woman who turns into a bear every evening. Truly. She can't help it. Her children have to make sure she never goes out at night.

So I was sort of the first to tread that kind of water to be, you know, concentrate on my form for over eight days. Michael's had that experience. He's going to do much better than anybody else-- at least I felt he was-- coming into these Olympics, because he's swimming exactly the same program that he was doing four years before.

Thus the notion of a concealed, entirely private solitary life, while worthy and indeed inspiring as an ideal, will of itself provide few if any of us with a sufficient guide to thought and action or with criteria by which to assess the day-to-day conduct of ourselves and others.

I would expect the 64 to offer a good ride in the conditions it is likely to be used.

" " If, in fact, there is a need for me to cast a vote for the resolution of the deficit crisis, I'll be there for that, " he said. " Although if I'm going to vote against what is proposed, going there is largely symbolic. Because you, in effect, can cast the same no vote by not being there.
But repeatedly in 2003, the president seemed to be daring them to move there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BUSH: We will meet that threat now with our Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Marines so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of firefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities.
The fundamental issue for those of us in uniform today is to maintain a capability. We have a small army. There are those situations where we may have to put soldiers and Marines in harm's way. Land mines are a capability that a commander has to help protect these soldiers or these Marines on the battlefield.
That's the gist of the political-responsibility statement. As individuals, religious leaders have the same rights-including the right to the secret ballot and the right to free speech-as every other American.

I could hardly contain myself. " Try it out, " Bob said, heading for the kitchen junk drawer, where goodies like batteries were kept.

The great advances in theoretical science began with Galileo. Whereas the Greek philosophers were inclined to search for perfect motion, Galileo posed a simple problem with only a few elements-calculating the motion of a falling body-that could be solved using the mathematics of his time.

' " I went running over and made the guy with a gun hit the ground. Sure enough, on his dashboard was a loaded 9mm pistol. I arrested him for carrying a deadly weapon.

As they poured out of the car, Alison explained. " We can't go to the concert on empty stomachs. We'll hunt for candy first.

" Their other child is a physician who has more money than mom and dad do, so it was not a matter of need, " Love explains. " They wanted to change their estate to provide the daughter a bigger share of the assets.
" " The houses are really far apart, " I said. Nobody told me this but I was hoping it was true. " You won't even be able to see her house. There'll probably be a forest separating us. " When he didn't say anything I added, " And don't forget... Sheila's scared of dogs so we can get Turtle after her anytime she tries to give us trouble. " Turtle is my dog.

God is in the detached heart, in the silence of prayer, in the voluntary sacrifice to pain, in the emptiness of the world and its creatures. God is in the Cross, and as long as we do not love the Cross, we will not see him, or feel him.... If the world and men knew....
I understand that's what everything looks like, and it feels like something new might be in me. Less fear, and I don't know how it got there. " Aren't we having fun? " she asks. " I'm going down there for a second, " I tell her. " Will you wait for me? " " Why? " " I just want to go down there for a second.
Good thing I have two eyeballs. I start to fear the worst when I don't see Matt anywhere, but my stomachache disappears when I don't find Sharon, either. I find my way to the kitchen and open the fridge to get a soda. Another arm reaches in beside me. I stop. I turn. Two brown eyes meet mine. A smile. It's Sharon Jameson in the flesh!
It's along the border between China and Hong Kong, and those troops are there to keep out the millions of Chinese eager to flock here to become part of Hong Kong. Everything else is just commentary. That is to say, in the great struggle over who will now influence whom-- China or Hong Kong-- don't write off Hong Kong so quickly.
He asked, without pleading, that they not let fear rule them, that it was crucial, perhaps desperately so, that the aliens know that humanity was not afraid of them. He ended by telling them that whatever happened, they would never regret being where they were now. It had been enough. They'd gone back to work, all but the handful who had already snuck home.
And I'm-- I'm surprised that that hasn't carried over a lot longer. And as for everything else, I can't think of any other really positive things that I'm happy about. Sweeping into office with this points of light and-- and it's not enough-- to tell people that if they'll go out and volunteer and spend their time is-- is not enough.
TOM RILEY, Long Island Insurance Agent: It would seem to me that if every individual were concerned with the cost of health care with the bill they had to pay when they went to a doctor's office, they might question a bill that was high. I just use an example- my wife went, she had a nasal infection. The bill was $300, and she was angry about it.
Furthermore, subjects listened to the music during the task as opposed to hearing the music prior to testing. Our results are not unexpected. Specifically, male subjects performed better when listening to the original soundtrack than they did when listening to Mozart, and performance was consistent with musical preference.
Toby looks out the window to see a mountain lion leap the fence with the dog in its jaws. He should be shocked. He wants to be shocked, and he wants to feel at least a little sympathy for the neighbor, who will no doubt feel terrible when he finds out what happened to his dog- and on Christmas day, to boot- but he can't suppress his wild grin.
But this is not a political issue. This is an issue that's about our national security, it's about the safety of the American people. It's bout making sure that we prevail on the war on terror. If we do not, the risks are very, very high and the stakes are very, very high, not only for that region, but for our country.
That's the only reason I came home. I don't want to entertain a bunch of people and I don't want any sympathy. " Even his voice was like his father's, with a military ring to it. I thought, maybe in another five years... All day Monday I rode with the men when they went downtown or to the bus station to pick someone up.
Our test is simply a blood test, again, from the mother. And we're measuring a different hormone than has been measured before. And our early data suggests that this test will be useful down as far as 11 weeks of pregnancy, so bringing the time frame of testing down from 15 or 16 weeks that we currently use to about 11 weeks.
This was once America's seventh largest company and these two men have maintained their innocence from the beginning. There's sort of an army of media here. In the distance there are police horses. They've been here before in this trial to control crowds.
His gaze slid downward to the packages beneath it-- including one that hadn't been there this morning. Bright green wrapping, with red ribbon and a red bow. About the size of a bread box. Had Sarah put something for him there after he'd left for work? He got up to see, but when he read the tag he felt a shiver of excitement run down his spine.
Neither sister went to public high school, so they missed out on such events. Seriously, it was the best time of my life, " Venus said of the party Serena threw. I had lace gloves. I was so' 80s it was ridiculous; I was disgusted with myself.
It was a horrible sight leaving. There were fires all over the place; smoke was filling the air. It was choking us. We looked back from about 20 miles down the road, and you could see New Orleans under what looked like a mushroom cloud. There were just pillars of smoke rising from the city, and a big cloud over the overhead.
I've told people what they should do because people coming forward, many of them don't mean it. Many of them are going to fall away. Many of them may be worse off than they were before they came. LARRY KING: So it's the total effect. Yeah. Well, I hope that in the year 2043, you fall over and I'm there broadcasting it. Rev. BILLY GRAHAM: Thank you, Larry!
Some mornings I don't get past the front page. Peggy walks up to the table with my plate. I examine the eggs over light, toast, and bacon. " Kathy has enough grease on this plate to fry a dozen eggs.

They run fast on land, but have trouble changing direction. While their powerful jaws can clamp tightly shut, the muscles that open them are weak. If a gator attacks, try to hold its jaws together, or have duct tape ready and tape them shut.
Adults from all walks of life are involved in community service, but people in the middle class and above, and those with more years of education, are more apt to participate in community service.

Her older son, Charlie, was in college. Her work as a writer required only a laptop. She was supposed to be traveling on to Hawaii, but cashed in her ticket and rented a house for eight months. The longer she stayed, the more certain she became that she had stumbled on the next chapter of her life story.
The film, Reality Bites, has a lot of references from earlier days, and it tells a pretty familiar story. Young men and women just getting out of college, misunderstood by their parents, having shaky love affairs. One works as the manager of a Gap store. Another wants to make documentary films. Another, Troy, doesn't want to work at all.
And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. He looks around and-- MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous. BOURNE steps out. Morning legs. # MARIE # I needed a break.
I will end with a comment on the word " unavoidable. " This dialogue is not just unavoidable but most useful, important and necessary. It is not that we are forced to talk to each other but that by the very nature of our existence we are called to share so many points of light and of life that our dialogue is not only unavoidable but irreplaceable.
I want some assurance that there will be no further hunting of children. " We would have to leave Earth early, " she said. " You can't prey on children. No matter what you pay, who you pay. you still can't do that. " The birds were silent. Z. Wayne looked at me. " I have a notion, " I said. Five months later I took my niece and her children to the Park.
All the usual reasons for a marriage to go kaput. Our marriage was not that way. Not at all. To do my marriage justice, a death is required. Death is the way it had to end, the only exit available, and Max had to be the one to take it because it wouldn't be logical for me to be the dead one.
As far as the children were concerned, she was " young Li ". Li did not mind. She was used to it, as that was what they had called her when she was a messenger girl. After Li's arrival, Mr Jin did not need to teach any more classes (apart from " farm labour " classes) and became even more slack.

A moment later, he turned his angry eyes at me. I saw the knife in his hand and I snapped. I emptied the gun until the center of the man's chest turned to alphabet soup. // I thought quickly about the things I might've touched while here at this man's home, but things had happened so fast that there wasn't time to touch much.
In fact, many of the country's rivers run north or south, whereas much of the country's power must move east or west. # And underwater lines are still more expensive than lines on transmission towers. Mr. Stern's 65-mile cable cost about $600 million, and a 53-mile cable under San Francisco Bay cost about $505 million.
No. She didn't consult with me. LARRY KING: Strong woman. Rev. BILLY GRAHAM: She's a strong woman and she did the right thing and she's built a terrific center there. I know a number of people that have been there. LARRY KING: Jimmy Carter. Rev. BILLY GRAHAM: Jimmy Carter- I've known him many years. LARRY KING: Same roots, huh? Rev.
-Just, wanted. To say it. He died four days after. The trick was the diet. As far as he could see, from what he'd read on Google. It wasn't really a disease. It was more like waiting to be a disease. Most people who had it didn't even know. Plenty of fresh stuff, vegetables and that.
Lots of concerns, concentrated concerns in cities like San Diego, certainly very heightened fear in the Miami area. But Mary, something was occurring on another level here that deeply concerned the gay and lesbian community in this country.
In the early 1980s Silicon Valley companies raced one another to get more customers, to remove cost and waste from their operations, to increase their production runs.

But government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this and we must. And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders.
Time passes, they are asleep. The witch comes. She has nine mouths all over her body, they are invisible. She can say nine times as many words as anyone else in the same time, this is the mark of the witch. Her mouths say nine times, Weep your last tears, my children, for I am going to eat you.

In 1980, 19 percent of all the students enrolled in the Princeton Review's SAT training course entered before January 1st of their junior year. By this year, that number had climbed to 52 percent. Yield only makes up a small percentage of an overall U.S.
But the owners had a couple of years to present a coherent plan, and they didn't present one until the 11th hour, and that plan was to try to shove a salary cap, which will never fly, down the throats of the players and a strike was almost inevitable.
Because I do not know the names of things, I do not express them. The words of a Spanish explorer in the new world-the old new world that he had left behind. Worse, without the names, without words, he was not certain he could see at all. What does a tree look like whose name you do not know? A flower without a name might be invisible.
My parents' attitude was, you've always got to work hard, you've always got to work that extra job, you've got to take advantage of every opportunity you've got. Q: When did you know you were conservative? A: My passion for politics began with the election of Ronald Reagan, which was the first election I could vote in.
She makes new curtains and plans music club programs. She considers Europe again, perhaps even Russia-a journey she does make, by the way, a year and a half later. She tours the Caribbean, her second trip to the area, and writes: " Passed San Salvador last night.
Then I do the cleaning and whatever else needs to get done, then we go out for our chores. I find the major difference over the course of the day is in the impulse decision, which I can't make anymore. That and pushing the cart and the stroller at once in the supermarket! People think it's a huge feat, they treat you like a hero.
Are you listening? Do you understand, Richard? Suspension. And I look up from my drawing, but I don't look at Mr. White. I stare out the window and I'm thinking yeah, suspend me. Kick me out if you want to. I ain't learning anything here anyway But what I say is yeah because Mr. White is such a shit and I don't want to listen to him any more.
@!CARROLL: Good morning to you, Miles. Not only was he very well armed, but apparently he held some sort of a grudge, a 20-year grudge. He wanted to exact his revenge on young girls and decided that the Amish schoolhouse was the perfect place to do it. He did it yesterday morning, again, taking his revenge out on little girls.
Rest in peace. " The room had a lone window, small and high on the wall. Twilight was fading, and the clock beside the window called the time quarter past eight. What day was it? Jason had the vague feeling an entire day had passed since his last memory, if not more. " What the hell happened? " Whit asked again. " Let's figure it out later.
" I feel like I'm gon na pass out, " Sunset said. " Don't do that, now, Miss Sunset. It bad enough you near naked riding along with a nigger, you don't need to have your head on my shoulder. " Sunset dipped her head and the feeling passed. When she sat back up and started to wipe her forehead with the back of her hand, she realized the gun was still in it.
He doesn't have a history of not showing up in court. They haven't charged him. So the police-- they're in a tough spot because the police have found themselves at the center of the media universe the way these cases go, and they don't want to act too quickly, but they don't want to act too slowly either.
The materials for the Solar Cone amount to about $25, the Pod's approximately double that. The cost of a drop frame can be anything from nothing if you have some scrap lumber to $25. Properly constructed and maintained, each solar appliance has an estimated life of 25 years or more.
It's amazing how you forget how much you need $750,000 a year until you don't have it. Things are finally starting to look plausible. The energy source will cost me two million dollars-three years' payments-and with that much juice flow ing through it, the equipment will destroy itself after one use. But it can be done. Everything's ready, but for the power.
I know a physicist who collects all sorts of " laws, " like the old saw about dropped peanut-buttered toast always falling face down. Well, he knows as well as I do that that is not a natural law. Sometimes, maybe as often as one out of every hundred or so droppings, the toast will fall dry side down. No one knows why. It just happens.
At half-past one, when she was snoring, he got up and dressed quietly. He found the velcro shoes in the bureau, put them in his pocket, and let himself out into the hall. p237 30In one way it was crazy, but on the other hand it would be crazier not to spend the money and get something for it, after spending so much for nothing. What if he got sick, though?
It'll kill you. " " My mother's coming back. " " She left your dad for some other guy. She left you, too. " The boy stared at him. " It's God's truth, little brother. Your dad told me all about it. Now. Run along. " The boy hurried to the yard and whispered into his dogs' sturdy necks. Their fur brushed his lips. " It's not true, " he said.
The only way to say it was straight out, " I was thinking, I mean I have this horrible task to do, ride all alone with it, with the gun... I might not make it. Would you...? " " Yes, " he said, " I'll go with you. " " Would you? Would you really? " " Yes, " he said. He went back in to get a hat. He came out and locked the door and put the key under the mat.

Ms-STREET: I want to win the downhill, but to be the first male or female to win three medals in three consecutive games, that's something that I would be proud of. Kind of like the cherry on top of my career, and I'm going to work my hardest to get it. The one thing that makes me happier is the thought of carrying the flag in the opening ceremonies.
The difficult decision to end the relationship has been made. Now the formal and complicated process of divorce begins. Should I Get a Lawyer? Absolutely. One of the famous lies in our trade is, " You won't need a lawyer; mine will take care of both of us. " That goes right along with " don't worry about anything, dear; you can trust me.
" I can't believe I'm sitting here spilling my guts out... and even you won't take me seriously! " Even me? Now, that pushes me over the edge. Like a good little graduate of an anger-management program, I finish chewing my veal. The food may be great, but everything else about this " magic " evening stinks.
I did what I could. I wrote on the board the assignment for the next class. I asked for questions. None of it had an effect. She did not sit down or take her eyes off me. None of the students spoke. None would look at her. When it was over, they left quickly. We were alone. She sat down and began to gather her things. " I am sorry, " I said.

She can just sit back and listen to Lucy going on about nothing. <STRONG> Lucy finds out about </STRONG> the baby in this way. It is another Friday, and the two of them have just finished their weekly Endless Luck session. The candle has been blown out, and the air smells like a burnt match.

But Willie never hesitated. He yanked himself away from Margaret again and began springing up and down. His eyes were still screwed shut, and over and over he made violent explosion noises. He was a rocket, a cannonball, a spaceship, a bullet, anything but a submissive child. " All right, " said Margaret, furious. " All right. Is this what you want?
I was sure Adam could see my hands trembling as I struggled for something clever to say. After what seemed an eternity, I told him I needed to find a seat and walked away. Considering the morning I'd had, I was in no mood for company. So I grabbed a spot in the back row, away from my family. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Adam. Go away!
This continuous process of feedback results in a common understanding about what is happening and the ability to check to see if that is indeed what one wants to happen.

" When I saw they had " Grandma's Beef Stew " on that menu, I didn't tell Dad, but I made a bet with myself: That's what he'll order. " He almost fooled me. Looking over at the next table he saw that someone had ordered swordfish and said,' That swordfish steak looks wonderful.
I felt about as low as a man could get. " Leon, how was it? " " Horrible. Worse than ever. " " What do you mean? " " I tried to hold back, Doc. I tried every trick in the book. I bit my lip, I tried to count, I even tried to imagine her wearing clown makeup, but it seems like the more I try to hold back, the more excited I get.
The organization, however, shares only identifying information such as names, birth dates and Social Security numbers nothing describing a teacher's past problems. States wanting more information about someone on the list can investigate further.
MICHAEL A. CLARKE Castro Valley Editor-- I'm a 52-year-old student of jazz who is disappointed that there is no longer a source for hearing the tunes and their original, or at least once-popular, versions that form the stuff of jazz standards that all the old cats know. These tunes are part of the currency required for admission to their musical world.
Then, during the day, she realizes it can not be so, because Dorothy has no interest in the things in the secretary. Dorothy has probably never even heard of such a place as Tiffany, where Rose once stood behind the long glass counters and brushed with royalty in the form of the Duke of Windsor and his men browsing through the silver and the jewelry.
" Keep shining his eyes so he wont go away, " one of the men called to Louie. " We don't want to lose it now. " Some of the men began crawling under the house where Louis was. Others moved closer in and took their places at the edge of the house.
Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it. Now back over here, see, we've got a $4 trillion debt, and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it- or 70 percent of it- financed five years or less.
It's supposed to be so soothing, she thought. Perhaps that is the soothing that I need. She leaned down into the dirt and dug until there was a hole a few feet deep. She placed her feet in it. I built this hole, she said, now what to put in it?
How did you confront those issues? Well, to be honest, I got really good professional help for the first time in my life. I can't pretend that I would have been able to do that on my own. All of my best attempts at fixing that situation had not worked. And I certainly have had a willingness to feel better.
Don't be concerned that by treating the situation seriously you'll encourage the behavior. If this is the first time he's cried wolf-or if it's something he does only every once in a while-take it in stride. One quick fix is to turn the tables on him. A child who's too sick to make his bed certainly isn't well enough to go to a movie!
Threatened finally, the home of the graveyard by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be, Scrooge changes his ways, and at that moment, he is home at last. The idea of being home for the holidays implies that one has been away. Thus, the return is that much sweeter, the happiness heightened by the desire to get there.
Is there indeed a common form of ethics that can be applied here? Dr. KING: That's certainly a difficult question, but I think that one's view of appropriate behavior is certainly conditioned by culture and cultural conditions and social conditions that are set out within national boundaries.
I don't know if what has happened is mainly a change of behavior, but not of underlying fantasy. So I'm very skeptical about it. But what I think is important is that homosexuals realize they can live with themselves. And I think it's very interesting what we heard, the reference to being clean.
Receiving fewer or cheaper gifts could be taken as an insult. As a bride, I can expect a gift for every holiday that comes up between now and my wedding. I don't care about any of this, but Ma says to keep my mouth shut. She received a pearl instead of a diamond ring, and she will never let anyone forget it.
Brian: Then a lane opened up in front of me So I raced through to the hoop. Narrator 1: Brian's cell phone rings. Brian: Hello? Hugh: Brian, it's Dad. Brian: How's Ellen? Hugh: She's going to be OK. She was still pretty weak from the baby. Brian: What a relief! Hugh: How's Sarah? Brian: Sarah is great! Hugh: Great? Brian: Yeah.
Well, I realized something that as an adult seems so simple but as a kid wasn't even in my realm of thought: Not only is the world so much bigger than just one social group (and its one douche bag), but I'd much rather be on the " outside " of the cool crowd than on the inside being kicked around. And once I realized that, I could stand up.
It really scared me the first time I saw her that way, no control over herself whatsoever. Her tongue began to lash out like the soft, pink head of a blind worm exiting her mouth, rising out of darkness, terrified by light. I tried to pry her jaw open to make the worm go back inside.
Maybe he would call her after dinner, or maybe he wouldn't. But then again, maybe one of their relatives had died. They had lost their mother and father several years ago, so that only left a small circle of aunts, uncles, and cousins. None of whom he likes well enough, or is close to enough, to warrant that he call his sister any earlier than after dinner.
I hope I don't sound like a Grinch this Christmas season... LAUGHTER... but I, I have some problems with our space program. BARON OK.

Yet it is plausible to argue that there were many more who simply could not believe the rumours that they may have heard.

Do you think he's right? POLLACK: This has been a constant refrain from the Bush administration. I don't think that I would necessarily go that far to say that somehow an increase in terrorists attacks should be taken as a positive sign that reconstruction is proceeding.

Russian troops were attacking and the army met with the mayor about what to do about the Japanese settlers. The mayor wanted them to be evacuated as soon as possible.

They could hear it as a song and not just some bollocks.
If it weren't for the photograph, I would scarcely believe that they and my Uncle Sam lived with us when I was 8.

And on February 12, University of Wisconsin-Madison students ended a 95-hour sit-in with not only public disclosure, but a commitment to payment of living wages and to women's rights.

I interviewed three or four of the top women players, and then I, kind of on a whim, I decided to enter the tournament myself. I had some good luck in a satellite, or preliminary event, and I won a seat.

In 1974, when I was 16, my mother came into my room wearing the same expression she had the day she left my father. " We are going to Alabama to get some money in the trust fund, " she said. " I'm sick and tired of never getting a dime from your father. " I did not ask why it was so important all of a sudden. I'd known about the trust fund all my life.
I mean, he was one of those incredible dogs. He was part of the family, and I just simply said to my guy- I said, " Look, I've got something much more important. " And I got home before the little ones got home, and I had one of the all-time days of my life, because we all got shovels. We went out in the yard. We dug the biggest hole.
She played them over and over in her mind. Why did the voice sound so sleepy? Would a maid really say " One moment " and promptly hand the phone to her husband? Would a maid even answer the telephone when a guest was in the room? The more Elaine thought, the more dubious the whole thing became.
He's got staying power, and I'm excited to see him get a new start. I knew he wanted that and to get in a winning situation. He's going to fit well. I'll tell you, it worries us because that was the missing piece with that team, that big-play tight end. He'll move the chains, but he's got those big-play tools.

James, meanwhile, learned all he could about the disease.
In the hearts of some Vietnamese there is always some emotional conflict connected with the United States. It was the U.S. government that failed to provide support as promised, leading to the fall of South Vietnam.

But I remember well the teller at my bank when I worked in Sacramento-- I used to wait in line until she was free. She lived around the corner from me in the old downtown section of the city in a two-story, white frame house. Every week she told me stories about her children. There will be no such woman in my boys' lives.
Things started to make sense after that. Then God filled the oceans and rivers and other bodies of water with all kinds of fish, including whales, although whales aren't fish, strictly speaking, but mammals like us.

" Right then and there, I knew New York was the place for me. It was a place where even if you missed the train, you got another chance.
Then I noticed a piece of paper in my pocket with my friend's new cell phone number (she was also an American living in Spain). I called her and she showed up right away to take my son for the night. Now that I'm in the sixth month of my third pregnancy, she's insisting that I leave my two kids with her when I have this baby.
I have pictured you, alone in your studio, feeling like such a screw-up, such a failure. I know how painful it is to long for a person when you realize it is too late-I know because I longed for you in that same way for weeks after you killed yourself.

Jay, for example-- he says his drug addiction is so bad, this 19-year-old, that he has to carry a gun now-- a gun to protect himself against all the people you owe money to. Who do you owe money to? JAY-@1Is-Afraid-He: A bunch of drug dealers...
So at age eleven my first camp experience ambushed me. After the first few days of novelty, I began to watch this great sink hole open in my heart and spread. By the end of the first week, I couldn't even remember how my parents looked, much less sounded. I strongly suspected they wouldn't show up to get me at the end of the month.
Very, very supportive. KING: You need that, didn't you? TI: Yeah, yeah, I did. KING: Do you ever fear you'll go back? TI: Do I fear I'll go back to what? KING: To bad things. TI: No, I don't fear that. Absolutely not. No. There's not a chance for that.
Subjects in both the experimental and control groups were assigned the psychology material during the same week.

Well, it was the same with what I was doing. Each' puzzle' would provide me with two kinds of assurance: the pieces would fit-- only one arrangement was possible-and the picture composed would be sensible and coherent. But on the 124th puzzle (no different from the rest), I ran into a wall.
But in reality, you know where they went: nowhere. They stayed home. " Home, wherever that might be, never sounded so good to many athletes these anxious days. Tiger Woods canceled a trip to a tournament in Paris. The United States' women's ice-hockey team won't be going to Finland. And the U.S.
Photograph How do engineers learn what happens in a crash? They create a crash. // WHAT HAPPENS IN A CRASH? There are three parts to a crash, all subject to Newton's First Law of Motion. You know Sir Isaac-he's the dude who discovered gravity in the 1600's.
Mao. Full-of-mice-shit. You are a historian, Nah. You should document my role in the revolution. I want you to demonstrate my sacrifices and contributions. Yes, you can do it. Forget about what your father will think about you. He is dead. I wonder what's happened to his ghost. I wonder if it rests in its grave. Watch out for his shadow.
If he kept his eyes moving, the water would not build up in them. It was water, not tears. Just water, because nothing bad had happened to make him cry. At least that is what he told himself. Still the picture jumped into his head of the walls of dirt inside his mother's grave.
What have I ever refused you but that one thing you asked me to do last time you were here-- when I was nearly wild with thinking about poor Mildred and the way I ran out on her funeral to hunt you down-- and what right did you have to ask for that when you never moved your mouth one time to say " I love you " or make the smallest promise?

It's in the women who have learned that fishing is a terrific thing to do, and that they're often better at it than men are. It's in the stories that people tell about their lives, and about America.

The Reagan administration and some people in Congress tried to make us look like crazies, and to some degree it worked. I remember having conversations with reporters in which they would say, Well, the administration says this is all wrong.' And I'd say, Look, why don't you cover the fucking hearing instead of coming to me with what the administration says?
It was still too hot to play outdoors. They had had their tea, they had been washed and had their hair brushed, and after the long day of confinement in the house that was not cool but at least a protection from the sun, the children strained to get out.

The batting coach will stand there and tell you, Oh, it's good, it's good,' and it's not, so you keep going after it. I'll tell him, It just doesn't feel right.' To me, you see, it's all about feel. When you have that feel in your body, when you have that pace, I don't have to ask anyone what I'm doing because I know, I know.
I wore a protective suit so thick that auxiliary motors were necessary to move the arms and legs. My rest periods were spent in an eight-by-six tomb of lead. The tomb's electronics were old-fashioned and half mechanical because the radiation ate up anything more advanced.
China says it's completed an investigation into a Chinese company's baby milk powder and there's no evidence it caused three infant girls to grow breasts.

Ms. COOK: Often, people say to me, " Well, at your age, do you have enough energy to do this? " Well, at 46, I am energetic and I'm very healthy as I think many women my age are. Yes, I do get tired and I confess I go to bed at 10:00 or 10:30, but just last week, I met a 26-year-old mother who says she goes to bed at 9:30. So I think all mothers get tired.

He clearly does not want to hear my tale of woe. Having your heart broken and thinking cocaine can fix it does not qualify as an appropriate topic for discussion with your banker. I know this from experience, so I skip the explanations and start right in on the serious begging. Please, I say, I'm okay now. I just got a good job.
But look at these pictures again. Look at these. These are Republicans and Democrats. Some of them want health care. Some don't. Some are pro-life, some are pro-choice.

" A very small proportion " may be high-earning college graduates in good health, as some analysts claim, but most are not.

I had no clue then how poor, how sick, how awful we could sometimes be. Nor any idea how rich, how strong, and how good. For that matter, I still didn't. Life can get better, it can get worse.

It's spring. Supposed to be doing something. A ringing sounds from inside the house. She stops and turns back toward the window. She hears Linda pick up the phone and begin to speak.

Nor did I see him in-- in the courtroom every day, such as we were getting the facts straight from the witnesses. SMITH: Mm-hmm.

There are a lot of women on this jury.
And in a market society in which you live, if you did things that weren't good, you went out of business. So the fact is that we've lost that community base. And I think the thrust of the book, the thrust of my ideas behind the book is that we have to get back to a community base. That's why I love your program so much, because you're an advocate.

He misses Papa. We only see him once a week and I don't think it is enough for the boy. He is an adolescent and he is going through many changes: school, neighborhood, friends...

Ghosts passed before me, around me, and it really didn't matter. They are around us, always, and we pay no attention. They are spirits of the past, and the past is friendly.

His 12-month target: A price in the mid- $ 30s, about a 50% gain. How does he come up with such a lofty gain? When the company's earnings were growing 16% a year, he says, the stock sold at close to the market's price-earnings ratio. Say you chop the P-E by 25% to factor in a slowing growth rate.

My new job let me be home most nights, my hedge-fund clientele indifferent to face time and insistent on buying their own meals, but the sad reality was that no amount of time now would ever make up for what I'd lost. My office is on the southern half of the floor, around the corner from the trading room.
Girls developing early have the same practical questions as older ones, and fewer places to get answers. What about swimming? What do I do when the teacher asks why I go to the bathroom so often?

My father wonders what he should do. Self-conscious, he does the best he can with a halfway gesture, the way seventh graders in our parish later used to bow.

It was so beautiful, so beautifully rounded, even with such narrow hips. I decided I would kiss her in the cave. I adopted the attitude I always adopt when I have to kiss someone for the first time.

You don't have to have sex on demand with whomever your Orion master says you have to. You're free to come and go as you please, and you actually earn a wage.
I mean, I- and I think that not- I don't think people tell me this on the campaign because of my relationship with her, but I think people respect the fact that she stood up and fought for her guy. I mean, I think that they obviously- I mean, we hit back hard and I think she probably said some things that- but she was in there, plugging away.
I think it's a recognition of the issue, and once we- when the public hears about this, I think, you know, it really defines the objectives, helps to better understand what needs to be done, I think.

Inside the refrigerator was a half pound of bacon. " No way, " said Mona. " I don't know how to make it. She'll know. " " Of course she'll know. We have to tell her.

We recognize that police have the right to arrest and courts the power to punish; we have neither. IV.

My husband's been supporting our whole family and he works very hard, and we have a pretty bad car that he has to recharge the battery and he's got battery acid all over his coat, so for Christmas he really needed a new coat. So he got one. SPRINGER: May you have a very merry Christmas.
I got up every morning excited about what would happen that day. If they find out about this police thing, they might never let me teach there again. " Now she was frantic. " Maybe they already know.

But if our trade deficit doesn't come down, how long can we wait before the industrial base of the U.S. is gone? We must have a strong industrial base if we are going to be a powerful economic nation. I've never heard of a nation that could live on service alone if it didn't have the basic support to keep the country moving: steel, rubber, and so on.
There was no cell service. The only option was to get out of there. We were three-quarters of a mile to the house. H: About halfway there, the bite started hurting too much, so my dad set me under a tree and ran for help. Fifteen minutes passed before he came back with the truck. It felt like hours. Once we were on the road, I started throwing up.
" His failures began to come more swiftly. " My marriage was a shallow relationship, " he says, " and when my wife left me for another man, I stood over my sons one night with a knife in my hand ready to kill them and burn the house down as revenge.

In due course Molly got a more reasonable stove, but her conception of herself as a cook never depended on it.

This right is real. It is very important. But like all constitutional rights, it only applies to the government. The Constitution and Bill of Rights simply do not apply to any private organization, including not applying to any private corporation.
As dogs go along sniffing posts, trees, etc., they can tell which dogs have been there and how long ago.

@!ANGLE: That was a rough area when you were there? LANG: Yes, sir. There were a few people we met, just a very few people, when we would go in houses and search houses, that the people would be really eager to help you out.

He didn't answer. They crossed Houston. Five minutes went by. Then: " You think you can smell the back pages of comic books! " She seemed on the verge of crying, of losing it like she'd done on the phone. He didn't know what exactly she was talking about, what it was that had so distressed her.

Someone could have given it to him. He did have a close friendship with the warden when the state pen was in Richmond-- the warden he later murdered. I suppose it's worth checking that out, in the event some of the tape somehow ended up there. " " Are we going somewhere?
California. Jackie, Bobby, good morning to both of you. Actually, I understand that there's a little bit of a problem right now with our audio and that you folks are hearing us.

They're convinced we somehow got to these folks, and somehow persuaded them to remain quiet. They're so bitter they will not look at me. The result is a jury of my dreams.

But she took this and everything else as a true sign that he was altogether different from her standard, a true sign that she had dropped to a deeper, more genuine and powerful level of feeling, a true sign that even deeper levels than she had ever imagined existed were available to her if she had the guts.

There's something I want to say to you'. Well to cut a long story short I simply told him that I thought he was possessed of the Devil, that if he remained he would be the end of a fine regiment, that it was my life too that would be destroyed in the process.

The method saves time when time is short. Turns out, last week's emergency wasn't much of an emergency at all. The $147,000 worth of emergency furniture in question is for six judges in the county's new traffic and juvenile court building. The furniture the judges use now is years old.

That was my mistake. That the damn big gun I'd seen the trainer holding was loaded with blanks, and was meant only to make a more-or-less convincing noise with which to command the elephants, hadn't occurred to me; I thought, naturally, that-now the beasts had gone nuts-he'd shot them dead.
An analogy might be: If I were hungry and a friend sent me a box of food, he would certainly want to be sure it got delivered to the right address. While it might warm my heart to know that he had made an effort on my behalf, it would do nothing for my stomach if his gesture had been in vain.

The mountain needs constant maintenance, which he does " as often as the paint comes in. Like if a pretty gallon of orange comes in, wow, I paint all the flowers orange. I just play it by ear. " In 1990, Salvation Mountain collapsed under the weight of all that paint-- Leonard estimates he's applied more than 100,000 gallons-and he rebuilt.
I went to my grandmother with my news, giving her the facts the way I believed she would have liked to receive them. " I have a scholarship to go to college in America, " I said. " All my expenses will be paid. My books, my tuition, my food. " I saw the lines on her face grow rigid.

I learned from local leaders about the history of African Americans' efforts to achieve the vote in Bullock County. It was a history of denial and delay.

The child didn't even cry when his mother died; too stunned, I suppose. I found him below in the house, starving, so I brought him home to stay with us, sooner rather than later. It wasn't long after he came to us that Mem found out she was sick herself. I was gutted when she told me.
And I hope very much that women's issues which I have believed need to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a woman, but because I understand that when women have economic and political power, nations are more stable.

But, hairy or not, it's my name nonetheless. It was my father's name before me, and his father's before him. I wish I could say it was a name I passed on to my own son. I can't.

His every movement seemed like frames of stop-motion animation thanks to my supernatural sight, so I didn't worry that he would pull his gun before I could react. But I hadn't expected that when my vision slipped into vampire mode the rest of me would, too.
High School, where I went to school, as well. And I graduated just a couple of years after you all did. Carol, let me start with you.

We all enjoy being together so much, it's not hard at all.
And they gave me coffee. And but it was kind of gray and see- through. And they apologized for it. And I didn't know from coffee then.

She was as good as either of them. She wanted to sing her own songs (it's easy to change a song about " loving him " to one about " loving Him "), but she never got the nerve. She sang her songs alone in the woods behind the dining cabin, in the half hour of free time after she finished the lunch dishes.
Everything fails eventually. My job is to figure out why some things fall apart too soon. I sort through all the variables and find out which ones contributed to failure. " He ignored me.

When they saw me coming, of course the joking stopped, but I could see they were still laughing to themselves thinking what the old preacher almost heard them say. I felt like telling them, I appreciate a joke as much as anybody. There have been many occasions in my life when I have wanted to say that. But it's not a thing people are willing to accept.
She looked back, wondering if Mary had come, too, and found her younger sister right behind her, so close that her steps brushed the hem of Elizabeth's skirts.

So, I said,' Fine.' We'll leave it there. But, they agree almost 100 percent that we should not wait till' 96. We can not let damaging things occur. The tax bill, as conceived, is not the best bill we could have, and there's no plan to balance the budget and pay down the debt. That's what they want. There's no discipline around spending yet.
Some changes coming up, we think. It should straight to drift more to the north or northwest by later today, possibly gaining some strength. The latest update, again, shows it's nearly stationery.

And the problem is, I think there's too many people in one room. There's too many thoughts, too many ideas going back and forth. And you don't need it. That's not how a deal gets solved. A deal gets solved when the powers that be, whether it's one person, two people or three people-- they get in the room together and they say,' Hey, you know what?
I just said I didn't want to take it. " She looked at him. " You already told them' no,' didn't you? " He poured again. " Yes. I'll find one that's better for me. You know I'm good enough. " " I do. You know I do. I just worry that employers might not think so after you've been out of work for long enough. " " What is that supposed to mean?

Without warning or explanation they simply disappeared, static on the empty dial. Stuart refused to give up; every hour he turned on the radio and spun through the frequencies. Static, more static, an occasional lunatic babbling (but who was a lunatic now, Melissa wondered, now that the whole world had gone insane?), more static.

There's lots of people who pay hefty fees for my services and knowledge, far more than Fleet offered, that's for sure. " She turned her head to look at Simon.
It is mysterious. It is beautiful. Even in the full glare of Mississippi July afternoon sun, it raises questions no one will remember to ask, and if they do, and if someone begins to answer, an interruption will occur, and no one will recall afterwards what was being said. There, I have done it too.
Here's where I think-- what I see going on in the country is this. The President has been an extremely good salesman for the notion of change. I think Mark is right. The country is behind him on that. I think they like the frame work of the President's program. All the polls you show say 60 percent or more like the program in general.
The military ethic will always be, if not at war, then at least in some measure of tension with the modem liberal state. I have up to now kept my discussion of ethics on a philosophical plane; I now want to ground the discussion in as practical and concrete a manner as possible.
More and more people join them as the truck makes a slow pilgrimage through the city. Bad (to my ear) and very loud recorded music blares from speakers on the truck. People begin to dance and sing. I follow, wondering what is going on. I manage to ask and to understand some part of the answers given me. I learn that an image of St.

A whole web of laws has been independently justified on the basis of getting tough on crime, but it really does add up to a trap for people.

What are you going to do with the population? I'm afraid that's really a political question. I can't, as a public health professional, I can say that there are certain dangers involved, but I couldn't attach a degree of urgency to them that would tell the authorities what to do. SAWYER Dr.

Stage fright was new to him, but so was playing stone-cold sober. He'd been on the wagon before, but never as long as this.

It was like he could read my mind because he had gone through the same experience. But even so, there wasn't a lot he could offer except, " Keep working hard. " If it were as simple as some people want you to believe, don't you think the Yankees would have gotten somebody to do something for me by now?
I feel like part of a ballet. It's as if I am dancing my Orthodox grandmother's role and for the moment don't ask more than to serve.

It was just a matter of deciding to follow it.
Once a friend was showing me some photo portraits in an art magazine. While she described them, she took my hand, and using my finger like a pencil drew over the page saying: " Here's his arm. Here's his back. His head is pointing this way, and this elbow is pointing this way.
Most of them turned up at the restaurant, sooner or later. But not many spoke English with such ease. He wore a brown felt hat, and his overcoat seemed cut to fit his shoulders; most of the other men seemed content to wear whatever would make do. " Come with me, " I replied, in Mandarin.

He is now promoting various entertainment enterprises in New York. " " We tried to land a job with him, " said Dolly, " but we couldn't even get by the girl in the front office. " " What it takes to get past girls in front offices, " I said, " I have got.
God. Maybe it was just the Valium, but I don't think so. That Joe and I were not ready to become parents was never a point of discussion.

A program wasn't a luxury-- it was survival. Let me put this in context. The straight men are candy-asses. How many times, dear reader, have you and I been hit on by men?
